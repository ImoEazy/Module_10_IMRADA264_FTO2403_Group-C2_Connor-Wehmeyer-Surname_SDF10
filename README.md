## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[API stands for application programming interface, it works as an intermediary between certain software apps. it enables the apps to communicate and work together. It is mainly used for data, service and capability exchange between different software coponents. An example of this i currently use is Paypal.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[ A interface is when two things meet or interact with each other (including people) e.g person using app system. whereas APIs are rules and regulations that help different software apps to communicate wit each other]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[The main components of API would be API request(info from the client) API response(the overall result/data given by server), Endpoint( a specific URL that gives access to a certain resource) and Method(specifies the type of operation on resources) and Server(this processes the request). Im interested in RESTful API as it is all about communication, also its beneficial because its standardised and used alot in the business industry. Also its performance stays high and seems like a basic neccessity for any business internal operation ]

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[ I have not yet fully interacted with API besides using them within daily life such as a paypal]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[I believe API can be made more simplified to understand and incorporate as a result of the growing scale of API immplementation. To enhance my understanding and skill i will have to interact and learn more about API specific to existing business]
